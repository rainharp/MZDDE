### Donate
ZOperator is written after work and completely free for all users, but we have a few expenses such as development tools and fees to preventing hair loss (LOL). We very much appreciate your support to cover our costs or perhaps simply buy us a beer which we can drink to you once in a while. You can also provide non-monetary support by promoting ZOperator on your blog, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, or your workplace. We thank you very much for your support! 

Sincerely, 

Terrence
